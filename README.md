# Physic Materials, Explained

This repository is intended to be a playground to see the impacts of changes to Physic Materials in Unity. 
It was implemented in support of [this tutorial video](https://youtu.be/Z3TE8cejwzk) explaining Physic Materials.

## Quickstart
In the demo scene there are two "scenarios" - balls on a flat plane, and boxes on a sloped plane.
You can mostly toggle between these at runtime without consequence.

On the "Canvas" object there is a "Main Menu" script that references all colliders and rigidbodies in the scene. 
You can add new objects, just be sure to register them on this object. The runtime UI controls will expand based on the available rigidbodies. However, I haven't tested what happens if scrolling is required on this UI.

Click play and you can manipulate the Physic Materials at runtime, reset the scenario, then apply forces to the active rigidbodies.
